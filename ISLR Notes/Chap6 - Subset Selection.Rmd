This lab on Subset Selection in R comes from p. 244-247 of "Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. It was re-implemented in Fall 2016 in `tidyverse` format by Amelia McNamara and R. Jordan Crouser at Smith College.


# 6.5.1 Best Subset Selection

Here we apply the best subset selection approach to the `Hitters` data. We
wish to predict a baseball playerâ€™s Salary on the basis of various statistics
associated with performance in the previous year. Let's take a quick look:

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse)
head(Hitters)
Hitters %>%
  view()
str(Hitters)
```

First of all, we note that the `Salary` variable is missing for some of the
players. The `is.na()` function can be used to identify the missing observations. It returns a vector of the same length as the input vector, with a `TRUE` value
for any elements that are missing, and a `FALSE` value for non-missing elements.
The `sum()` function can then be used to count all of the missing elements:

```{r}
Hitters %>%
  select(Salary) %>%
  is.na() %>%
  sum()
```
```{r}
sum(is.na(Hitters))
```


We see that `Salary` is missing for 59 players. The `na.omit()` function
removes all of the rows that have missing values in any variable:

```{r}
# Print the dimensions of the original Hitters data (322 rows x 20 columns)
dim(Hitters)

# Drop any rows the contain missing values
Hitters = Hitters %>%
  na.omit()

# Print the dimensions of the modified Hitters data (263 rows x 20 columns)
dim(Hitters)

# One last check: should return 0
Hitters %>%
  is.na() %>%
  sum()
```

The `regsubsets()` function (part of the `leaps` library) performs best subset selection by identifying the best model that contains a given number of predictors, where **best** is quantified using RSS. The syntax is the same as for `lm()`. The `summary()` command outputs the best set of variables for
each model size.

```{r}
library(broom)
library(leaps)
regfit_full = regsubsets(Salary~., data = Hitters)
summary(regfit_full)
```
```{r}
tidy(regfit_full) %>%
  view()
```


An asterisk ("\*") indicates that a given variable is included in the corresponding
model. For instance, this output indicates that the best two-variable model
contains only `Hits` and `CRBI`. By default, `regsubsets()` only reports results
up to the best eight-variable model. But the `nvmax` option can be used
in order to return as many variables as are desired. Here we fit up to a
19-variable model:

```{r}
regfit_full = regsubsets(Salary~., data = Hitters, nvmax = 19)
reg_summary = summary(regfit_full)
```

Notice that rather than letting the results of our call to the `summary()` function print to the screen, we've saved the results to a variable called `reg_summary`. That way, we can access just the parts we need. Let's see what's in there:

```{r}
names(reg_summary)
```

Excellent! In addition to the verbose output we get when we print the summary to the screen, the `summary()` function also returns $R^2 (\tt{rsq})$, RSS, adjusted $R^2$, $C_p$, and BIC. We can examine these to try to select the best overall model. Let's start by looking at $R^2$:

```{r}
reg_summary$rsq
```

We see that the $R^2$ statistic increases from 32% when only
one variable is included in the model to almost 55% when all variables
are included. As expected, the $R^2$ statistic increases monotonically as more
variables are included.

Plotting RSS, adjusted $R^2$, $C_p$, and BIC for all of the models at once will
help us decide which model to select. Note the `type="l"` option tells `R` to
connect the plotted points with lines:

```{r}
# Set up a 2x2 grid so we can look at 4 plots at once
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(reg_summary$rss, xlab = "Number of Variables", ylab = "RSS", type = "l")
plot(reg_summary$adjr2, xlab = "Number of Variables", ylab = "Adjusted RSq", type = "l")

# We will now plot a red dot to indicate the model with the largest adjusted R^2 statistic.
# The which.max() function can be used to identify the location of the maximum point of a vector
adj_r2_max = which.max(reg_summary$adjr2) # 11

# The points() command works like the plot() command, except that it puts points 
# on a plot that has already been created instead of creating a new plot
points(adj_r2_max, reg_summary$adjr2[adj_r2_max], col ="red", cex = 2, pch = 20)

# We'll do the same for C_p and BIC, this time looking for the models with the SMALLEST statistic
plot(reg_summary$cp, xlab = "Number of Variables", ylab = "Cp", type = "l")
cp_min = which.min(reg_summary$cp) # 10
points(cp_min, reg_summary$cp[cp_min], col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)

plot(reg_summary$bic, xlab = "Number of Variables", ylab = "BIC", type = "l")
bic_min = which.min(reg_summary$bic) # 6
points(bic_min, reg_summary$bic[bic_min], col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
```

```{r}
tidy(regfit_full) %>%
  mutate(num_var = row_number()) %>%
  gather(key = 'measures', value = 'value', adj.r.squared, BIC, mallows_cp) %>%
  ggplot(aes(num_var, value))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(measures~., scales = 'free')
```


Recall that in the second step of our selection process, we narrowed the field down to just one model on any $k<=p$ predictors. We see that according to BIC, the best performer is the model with 6 variables. According to $C_p$, 10 variables. Adjusted $R^2$ suggests that 11 might be best. Again, no one measure is going to give us an entirely accurate picture... but they all agree that a model with 5 or fewer predictors is insufficient, and a model with more than 12 is overfitting.

The `regsubsets()` function has a built-in `plot()` command which can
be used to display the selected variables for the best model with a given
number of predictors, ranked according to a chosen statistic.  The top row of each plot contains a black square for each variable selected according to the optimal model associated with that statistic. 

To find out more about this function, type `?plot.regsubsets`.

```{r}
plot(regfit_full, scale="r2")
```

As expected, $R^2$ is maximized by the model that contains all 20 predictors.

```{r}
plot(regfit_full, scale="adjr2")
```

Adjusted $R^2$ downselects to just 11 predictors. We can use the `coef()` function to see which predictors made the cut:

```{r}
coef(regfit_full, 11)
```

```{r}
plot(regfit_full, scale="Cp")
```

$C_p$ downselects further, dropping the `LeagueN` predictor and bringing the number down to 10: 

```{r}
coef(regfit_full, 10)
```

```{r}
plot(regfit_full, scale="bic")
```

We see that several models share a BIC close to âˆ’150. However, the model
with the lowest BIC is the six-variable model that contains only `AtBat,
Hits, Walks, CRBI, DivisionW,` and `PutOuts`:

```{r}
coef(regfit_full, 6)
```

# 6.5.2 Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection
We can also use the `regsubsets()` function to perform forward stepwise
or backward stepwise selection, using the argument `method="forward"` or
`method="backward"`.

```{r}
# Forward
regfit_fwd = regsubsets(Salary~., data=Hitters, nvmax=19, method="forward")
summary(regfit_fwd)
```
```{r}
plot(regfit_fwd, scale = 'bic', col = 'steelblue', main = 'BIC values for different number of predictors')
```
```{r}
for (i in 1:19){
  print(names(coef(regfit_fwd, i)))
}

```



```{r}
# Backward
regfit_bwd = regsubsets(Salary~., data=Hitters, nvmax=19, method="backward")
summary(regfit_bwd)
```
```{r}
for (i in 19:1){
  print(names(coef(regfit_bwd, i)))
}
```

We see that using forward stepwise selection, the best onevariable
model contains only `CRBI`, and the best two-variable model additionally
includes `Hits`. For this data, the best one-variable through six-variable
models are each identical for best subset and forward selection.
However, the best seven-variable models identified by forward stepwise selection,
backward stepwise selection, and best subset selection are different.

```{r}
coef(regfit_full, 7)
coef(regfit_fwd, 7)
coef(regfit_bwd, 7)
```
